# Holiday Entitlement

The holiday entitlement of employees at a company is calculated as follows:
employees of department 1 have 24 basic days' holiday, employees of other departments have 20 basic days' holiday. 
Employees over the age of 55 are given 5 extra days' holiday, and employees who have been with the company for more 
than 10 years have 3 extra days' holiday.
A program must be developed in which the date of birth and the date of joining the company (format `ddmmyyyy`) and a 
four-figure payroll number can be entered for each employee. The first figure of the payroll number corresponds to the 
department. The holiday entitlement for each employee must be calculated and shown. The cumulative total of days' 
holiday, the average number of years of service and the oldest employee must also be shown.
